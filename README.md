##  Bio
I'm born and raised Virginia Beach, VA, where music played a key role in my upbringing! I develop video games, wrestle, read Existentialist Philosophy, and passionately study Computer Science.
In completing my rigorous liberal arts education at Washington and Lee University, I developed my artistic and linguistic expertice while studying Computer Science. I now tirelessly blend my audio engineering, writing, UI design, and programming skills to create video games. I am interested in cybsecurity as well as the structure of the internet, as these two entities will continue to play dominant roles in our lives as technology advances rapidly. My Github portfolio consists of projects I have completed during my undergraduate study as wel as video games that I developed independently.<br>

If you are interested in making video games with me, please reach out! I would love to collaborate!
Please follow my journey as I master the art of video game design!

##  Current Projects
For a great example of how I code, see **War and Keys**

###  Majestus - Projected Release Spring 2026
- my biggest passion project, and the first video game I ever designed
- a story-driven action-adventure RPG inspired by The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy
- will be released for Nintendo Switch, Xbox, Playstation, and PC platforms
###  Yokai Assassination - Projected Release Winter 2025
- will be my first game published for ios/mobile devices
- an action/detective game where you eliminate ghostly imposters
- but don't get tricked into killing your friends!
###  War and Keys - Projected Release Winter 2025
- a tower defense game centered around typing
- will be released for PC before reformatted to run on mobile devices

###  Musical Synthesizer
- allows the user to synthesize different instrumental sounds by applying math to sine waves.
- also allows the user to compose songs, allowing them to specify a bpm and build each measure of the song.
- this project is currently very rough, but I am working on reorganizing my code and creating a graphical user interface to simplify the process of sythesizing sounds and producing music.
