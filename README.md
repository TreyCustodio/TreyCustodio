##  Bio
I'm born and raised Virginia Beach, VA, where music played a key role in my upbringing! I develop video games, wrestle, read Existentialist Philosophy, and passionately study Computer Science.
In completing my rigorous liberal arts education at Washington and Lee University, I developed my artistic and linguistic expertice while studying Computer Science. I now tirelessly blend my audio engineering, writing, UI design, and programming skills to create video games. I am interested in cybsecurity as well as the structure of the internet, as these two entities will continue to play dominant roles in our lives as technology advances rapidly. My Github portfolio consists of projects I have completed during my undergraduate study as wel as video games that I developed independently.<br>

If you are interested in making video games with me, please reach out! I would love to collaborate!
Please follow my journey as I master the art of video game design!

##  Current Game-related Projects
For a great example of how I code in **Python**, see **Another March Through Reverie** and **War and Keys**

###  Audio Engineering Application
- allows the user to synthesize different instrumental sounds by applying mathematical functions to sine waves

- the project is in a rough state; I am currently refactoring and creating a graphical user interface
###  Majestus
- the first video game I ever designed; a passion project that 
- a story-driven action-adventure RPG inspired by The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy
